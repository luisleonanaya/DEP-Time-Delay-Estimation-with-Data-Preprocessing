def clear_frame(frame):
    """
    Clears all widgets from a given Tkinter frame. This function is useful when you need to dynamically update the contents of a GUI window, such as when transitioning between views or refreshing the interface.

    Args:
        frame (tk.Frame): The Tkinter frame object from which all child widgets will be removed.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return a value. Its primary purpose is to remove widgets from the specified frame.

    Raises:
        None: No explicit errors are raised by this function. If the frame is None or does not contain any children, the function exits without action.

    Usage:
        This function should be called with a Tkinter frame object as its argument. It iteratively destroys all child widgets of the frame, effectively clearing the frame for new content. This operation is crucial in dynamic GUI applications where the display needs to be updated or changed based on user interaction or other events.
