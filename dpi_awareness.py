def set_dpi_awareness():
    """
    Sets the DPI (Dots Per Inch) awareness for the application to ensure that GUI elements are scaled correctly for high DPI displays. This function is particularly useful for Windows operating systems where DPI scaling can affect the appearance of the application's user interface.

    The function attempts to set the process DPI awareness to the system DPI setting. If this operation fails (e.g., due to missing libraries or being called on a non-Windows OS), the function will silently pass without raising an exception.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return a value and has no parameters. Its primary purpose is to enhance the visual fidelity of the application's GUI on high DPI displays.
